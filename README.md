# Shoe Inventory Management System
This Python project implements a shoe inventory management system. It includes a Shoe class for storing and managing individual shoe records, allowing users to capture new shoe data, view existing records, restock shoes, search for specific items, calculate the value per item, and find the product with the highest quantity in the inventory. The data is stored in a text file, and the system provides an interactive command-line interface for user interaction.

How to use this program:

Viewing Shoe Data:

When you run the program, it presents you with a menu.
To view the details of all the shoes in the inventory, choose option 2 ("View All Shoes"). This will display information about each shoe, including its country, code, product, cost, and quantity.
Adding New Shoes:

To add a new shoe to the inventory, choose option 1 ("Capture Shoe Data").
You'll be prompted to enter details for the new shoe, including the country, code, product name, cost, and quantity.
Once you've entered this information, the new shoe will be added to the inventory.
Restocking Shoes:

If some of your shoes are running low in quantity and need to be restocked, choose option 3 ("Restock Shoes").
The program will identify the shoe with the lowest quantity and ask if you want to increase its quantity.
You can enter the new quantity, and the program will update it in the inventory.
Searching for a Shoe:

To search for a specific shoe in the inventory, choose option 4 ("Search for a shoe by its code").
Enter the code of the shoe you want to find.
The program will display the details of the shoe with that code if it exists in the inventory.
Calculating Value Per Item:

If you want to know the total value of each shoe item in the inventory, choose option 5 ("Value per Item").
The program will calculate the total value (cost * quantity) for each shoe and display it.
Finding the Product with the Highest Quantity:

To find the product in your inventory with the highest quantity, select option 6 ("Highest Quantity Product").
The program will identify the product with the highest quantity and display its name.
Quitting the Program:

To exit the program, choose option 7 ("Quit").
This will terminate the program and return you to the command prompt.
